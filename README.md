# advent-of-code-2022
Making an attempt to keep the coding skills sharp near the end of this year.

One thing to note is I had to adjust the repo connection to make it work on my laptop with the key being "jimmymash@" added to the front of https
e.g. "git remote set-url origin https://jimmymash@github.com/jimmymash/advent-of-code-2022.git"
